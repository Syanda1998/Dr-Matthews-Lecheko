          <h2>Overview</h2>
          <p>In this document I will address the five criteria that has been set out as the requirements for the Teaching awards portfolio. My 
            Teaching Portfolio is based on my self-reflection and a critical analysis of my teaching and learning principles, beliefs, approaches, 
            strategies, and current practice.</p><br>
          <p>I primarily focuses on the outcomes of my <a href="docs/Motivation letter.pdf" download> experience as a lecturer</a> in the Department of Environmental Health in the Faculty of Natural 
              Sciences at the Mangosuthu University of Technology (MUT), which I joined in  <a href="docs/appointment as acting HOD Environmental Health MUT.pdf" download>2002 – 2006 and 2014</a> until now. However, my ideologies and 
              approach to teaching and learning are the results of a development and refinement process over the last 11 years and academic development 
              through studies focusing on being a better  <a href="docs/certificate.pdf" download>university teacher</a> since I started to 
              work in higher education. I have thought many  <a href="docs/Teaching responsibilities.pdf" download>subjects in Environmental Health</a></p>
          
          <br><p><b>My knowledge development is categorised into two knowledge forms:</b></p>
          <p>The first: Mode one of knowledge production which is the disciplinary knowledge that I have acquired as Environmental Health scholar 
              and through the professional practice (guided by strict registration and affiliation with a professional board – HPCSA) as 
              Environmental Health Practitioner. The second: Mode two of knowledge production which is multidisciplinary that I have acquired as 
              a university teacher and as a researcher. My mode one has formed a good foundation for my mode two. My teaching and learning 
              engagement is student centred.</p><br>

          <p>My experience as a teacher in higher education comprises both teaching and some supervision in academic environment. My 
            progression in my career as a University of Technology Teacher and Environmental Health Practitioner can be summarised as follows: 
            <ul>
              <li>Lecturer ;2002 - 2004 in the Mangosuthu University of Technology (MUT) National Diploma in Environmental 
                  Health – teaching various modules in the department as allocated by the HOD.
              </li>
              <li>
                  Acting <a href="docs/appointment as acting HOD Environmental Health MUT.pdf" download>Head of Department (HOD)</a>
                  ; 2005 - 2006 in the Mangosuthu University of Technology (MUT) HOD duties 
                  and lecturing. The main reason for appointment as Acting HOD, I was the only lecturer in the department 
                  registered with the professional board for environmental health (HPCSA) as Environmental Practitioner with the 
                  master’s qualification. The professional board is very strict on registration in our profession.
                  This was the most difficult period in out department; for the first time we had evening classes and a total 
                  number of 120 new students. Our Professional Board (HPCSA) was prompted to conduct a special audit of our offering. 
                  We managed to survive that process. All our students were accepted to be registered as Environmental Health Practitioners (EHPs).
                  The HOD post was advertised. I was the only candidate who was interviewed, my current HOD was part of the panel coming 
                  from DUT representing the profession. 
                  The outcome was that I should continue to act and be supported by the Dean of the faculty until such time a decision is taken.
              </li>
              <li>
                  Researcher in University of Cape Town (UCT); 2007. I was appointed as a researcher in UCT, while registered as a PhD student. 
                  Short stay due to financial and family commitments.
              </li>
              <li>
                  Environmental Health Practitioner; 2008 – 2013. I worked for the department of Health and the Alfred Nzo District Municipality.
              </li>
              <li>
                  Lecturer 2014 until now; teaching four modules and participating in all other duties of academic staff members. 
              </li>
          </ul>
        </p>
          
            <p>My teaching and learning experience has grown over the years. I also visit other institutions as a visiting lecturer to hone my 
              teaching skills. I also invite engage visiting lecturers to arouse curiosity in my students. Over the years we have formed a group 
              with colleagues from other departments to work together in other to improve our teaching and learning skills.</p><br>

          <h2> Philosophy of teaching</h2>
          <p>The Forth Industrial Revolution (4IR), the information age, when the entire body of knowledge is available regardless of the 
            classroom and textbooks, the role of education has rapidly changed; what in ages past could be obtained only in the classroom 
            or textbooks is now in reach within no time. However, the role of a teacher as a facilitator of learning has become increasingly 
            important and crucial. In the sciences, this importance has rarely been more pronounced: the world is replete with ideas and 
            information, but it is impossible to sort those without the broad comprehension achieved through truly deep learning. Therefore, 
            in a world and community confronted with the complex issues of pandemics like Covid 19, climate change recent floods in KZN, global 
            food crises, genetic engineering, and environmental degradation, science education has never been more important. Certainly, I 
            believe Environmental Health is a necessary education for the 21 century.</p><br>
          <p>My philosophy of teaching is based on comprehensions derived both from my own experience and from the current scholarship 
            of teaching and learning. </p><br>

          <p>Over the years I have learned to engage my students in deep learning. Deep learning as an active, intellectually rigorous 
            process that requires meaningful engagement with the learning materials. </p><br>
          <p>Deep or significant learning begins with curiosity, so the first and most important step in encouraging meaningful learning 
            is instilling in my students a sense of sincere, personal curiosity. I involve my students in relevant projects that arouse 
            their curiosity. To achieve this, I begin every lecture with real-world, relevant topics that are meaningful to Environmental 
            Health students, such as exploring the current environmental health issues. </p><br>
          <p>For example, this year I started by focusing on Covid 19 as environmental health problem – spreading mechanism and controls 
            and KZN floods, destruction of housing more especially informal settlements and housing them in shelters. The vital characteristic 
            of deep learning is the personal ownership of learning based on students’ personal experiences, and so most of the class time is 
            spent on students actively investigating and finding the answers to complex environmental health issues.</p><br>
          <p>Through this technique, students truly own the lesson and apply that same inquiry process to more varied and broader problems, 
            which is one of the most powerful aspects of active learning and the flipped classroom. In this teaching framework, my role is to 
            open the door and let my students see the environmental health issues that need critical thinking. </p><br>
          <p>Teaching and Learning is a demanding intellectual act requiring extensive preparation and scholarship distinct from control of 
            the subject material.</p><br>

          <p>Most of my teaching methods follow inquiry-based ideas: rather than giving students answers to complex issues, we work through issues 
            as collaborators, and I step in primarily to expand on critical topics and address major misconceptions. A key element of effective 
            teaching is thoughtful assessment design, especially the inclusion of a variety of frequent and informal assessment techniques. This 
            means that much of my assessment consists of asking students to not only present an idea to me, but to explain where that idea comes 
            from, the evidence that supports it, and how it might be applied to new situations. Classroom discussions play an essential role in my 
            assessment of students’ learning, as they allow the entire class to work together towards the solutions to the initial problems or 
            questions of a day’s classroom time. Another aspect of my teaching that has intensely increased student learning is the explicit 
            consideration of not only my own course but also its role in the entire Environmental health curriculum, an entirely holistic approach 
            that focuses primarily on developing skills that are expected in higher-level classes. These key strategies make up the framework of 
            my approach to fostering excellent undergraduate educational experiences.</p><br>
          <p>Curriculum design within the framework of significant learning, which emphasizes rich learning experiences, multi-faceted learning 
            beyond simple content delivery, and skills-based learning goals.</p><br>
          <p>The combined holistic teaching and curriculum design approach, have the potential to foster deep and powerful learning that prepares 
            students not only for their degrees and careers, but also for a life beyond the classroom as flexible, self-directed learners. In a 
            world characterized by rapid change and complex issues, I firmly believe this is one of the most powerful things that an admirable 
            environmental health programme can present.</p><br>

          <p>I have worked with many diverse student groups and professionals in terms of number of learners, age, cultural background, expectations, 
            content and aim of the learning activity. This has required a continuous complexity and customisation of my teaching approach and methods. 
            In fact, as observed by Ramsden (1992:102), “good teaching is open to change”. This is a key principle in the transition towards the 
            “Learning Paradigm” (Barr and Tagg, 1995: 13), which is related to the evolution of the function of universities from institutions 
            essentially for teaching to institutions responsible for learning, joining teaching and research (CHE, 2004). </p><br>

          <p>My approach is oriented to let students understand environmental health as integrated complex systems, debating each topic through a 
            holistic approach that addresses problems from a variety of perspectives, and relates environmental health aspects to environmental, 
            social and economic implications, which are the three pillars of the sustainable development (UN, 2000).</p><br>
          <p>Since I joined MUT, I have been focusing my practice on the South African and International realities and relevant challenges that 
            need to be faced in the Environmental Health Services and in the Department of Health. I have also put effort into linking the 
            criteria of social sustainability with the South African ubuntu philosophy, according to the “Africanization” goal for South 
            African higher education promoted by Higgs and van Wyk (2006).</p>

          <h2> Teaching Approaches </h2>
          <p>Since I joined MUT as a lecturer, I have dedicated great effort into improving teaching and learning practices within the Environmental 
            Health curriculum. The transition towards a transformative learning-based model in South African higher education has been supported by 
            the development of institutional Teaching and Learning strategies able to lead the change (CHE, 2004). The improvement of my teaching 
            methods has been influenced by the completion of the Post Graduate Diploma in Higher Education, particularly the modules on Teaching 
            and Learning, Assessment and Research Supervision.</p><br>
          <p>I have adopted a completely open-door policy so that if my students need further assistance, I am always available to provide further 
            clarification, explanation, especially to motivate them, encourage their thinking, reflection and discussion. During the contact sessions 
            I clarify and highlight the purposes and intended outcomes of each session and learning task. </p><br>

          <p>I always try to inspire their critical thinking, making connections with previous knowledge and other modules, thus trying to maximise 
            their awareness of their gradual knowledge and skill development. I often highlight those problems that must be assessed by multiple 
            perspectives and in the municipalities and the department of health. Students must critically think about the problem and find their 
            own way to face it, with a combination of understanding, gradual knowledge creation, critical thinking, passion and creativity.</p><br>
          <p>I regularly alternate during the sessions the teaching mode, switching from formal lecturing and audio style to more visually-driven 
            methods e.g., video presentation,  AnswerGarden, slideshow and virtual – from zoom to Teams.</p><br>

          <h2>Curriculum Development</h2>
          <p>I have arrived in MUT for the second time in 2014, finding the Department of Environmental Health in the transition of their offering 
            from the National Diploma in Environmental Health (3 years) to Bachelor of Science in Environmental Health (4 years). I have been 
            working with the colleagues in the department to develop the current curriculum. We have addressed this matter as a teamwork. 
            The continuous debate with the colleagues regarding the current curriculum review for accreditation purposes, new curriculum 
            development, module development and review, gap analysis, identification of strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats for 
            our programme and in relation to its future development has proceeded over the last four years. </p><br>

          <p>I believe that our curriculum is based and reshaped by sustainable development goals and adapted to fulfil the requirements of the 
            contemporary and future Environmental Health challenges and to develop higher-level skills for our graduates to work more effectively 
            in the industry. </p><br>

          <p>I have attended and proactively contributed to all the workshops and staff meetings that we have organised for team working on curriculum 
            development and accreditation purposes. I personally developed materials for four modules for the BSC programme (Sustainable development 
            101, Environmental Health Promotion 02, Environmental Health Law, and legal Process III and Environmental Health Law, and 
            legal Process IV).</p><br>
          <p>My Head of Department (HOD) and other academic staff members are aware of my significant and robust contribution to the curriculum 
            development process and teamwork. PGDIHE modules included the “Designing and Evaluating Curricula in Higher Education” this module 
            helped me to understand curriculum in higher education better.</p><br>

        <div class="section-title">
          <h2>Approaches to assessment and feedback</h2>
          <p>To foster higher order thinking and encourage independent learning, I give a wide array of assessments namely, Multiple choice, 
            Projects, Group work, Tests, Assignments, and Presentations. These assessments are administered differently but blooms taxonomy 
            is used to grade the level of questions. The type and purpose of my assessments vary due to the circumstance and needs of my students. 
            I give both formative and summative assessments – Some assessments are meant to foster certain skills such as teamwork, some are meant 
            to encourage student to do introspection etc. In this section, I go through some examples of the assessments I give my students and 
            how and when, and for what purpose I administer them. I further explain the form of feeback given after each type of assessment. </p><br>

          <p>Blooms taxonomy was used to grade the level of questions to ensure that the formative and summative assessments were pitched at the 
            correct level. An attempt was made to ensure that at least 60% of the questions were based on concepts taught in class. The remainder 
            of the questions varied containing problem-solving skills that students needed to analyse and apply based on concepts taught in class. 
            At least 10% of the marks came from questions that required students to create new knowledge based on their existing knowledge</p><br>

          <p><b>Formative assessments to foster higher level thinking:</b> To foster cross pollination of ideas and knowledge sharing amongst student peers, 
            I usually give my students formative assessments in the form of group projects.  Each group projects is then evaluated and critiqued by 
            other group members while providing feedback. This change of role fosters the engagement of higher order thinking skills since it requires
              students to look at the subject from a totally different angle as they evaluate each other’s submissions. While taking cognisance of 
              the feedbacks, I then provide model answers aimed at helping the students to relook at their initial solution approach or design. This 
              approach allows students to have two types of feedback – firstly the feedback on their submission and secondly the feedback on their 
              evaluation. These types of feedback invoke student learning in ways that are unique and beneficial to the students.</p><br>

          <p><b>Assessments to develop teamwork skills:</b>  Environmental Health involves working in teams of different stakeholders. Therefore, to 
            promote the development of team skills, I adopt a group project teaching and learning approach. Students are expected to form their 
            own groups using a set of stipulated rules: each group is made up of 5 or 6 members, contain two females or more and three males 
            (due to the demographics of the class). This method was used to ensure that all the groups were at a similar academic level and as 
            a way of making sure that students at risk learn from their peers.  The group dynamics allowed students to cross-pollinate ideas 
            and find solutions amidst conflicting ideas. The fourth years that do their research work in groups of two. Through an intensive 
            evaluation of the group projects approach to teaching, I found that giving students a one-month deadline to complete the case study 
            was futile since most students completed their work in the last week of the due date. As a result, I changed how the tasks were 
            assessed giving students clearly defined milestones to achieve at the end of a week. If a case study was given four weeks to 
            complete, each week had a deliverable for submission, hence causing them to be actively involved in the project over the three 
            or four-week process. Furthermore, to inspire academic and professional discipline, I designed a peer evaluation form that allows 
            student to rate group members after a group project. The result of this evaluation is then used to determine the contribution of 
            each group member towards the success of the project. This encourages all students to participate in group assignments and think 
            independently rather than rely on the group members. Feedback for these types of activities is given in the form of discussions 
            in class.</p><br>

            <p><b>Self-Evaluation Assessments:</b> Mock examination: Before examinations, I ensure that adequate preparation is made by my students 
              by giving them a self-evaluation mock exam, where students are expected to write a 3-hour paper under exam conditions. At the 
              end of the mock exam, students are provided with the model answers and an elaborate explanation of what was expected. This mock 
              exam is aimed at giving students an opportunity for self-introspection by assessing their own readiness before the actual 
              exam.</p><br>

              <p><b>Summative Assessments:</b> To evaluate student learning at the end of an instructional unit, summative assessment are conducted. To 
                meet the required standard with regards to the level and phrasing of question, as well as ensuring that the duration is adequate 
                for students to complete the assessment, all assessments are internally moderated. At the end of each assessment students are given 
                a marking grid to help them understand how the marks were distributed in a more detailed manner compared to the mark allocation that 
                appeared after each question on the question paper. Furthermore, after marking the script, the marking guide is used as feedback to 
                the student onto which a clear explanation is given to indicate which aspect of their computer program was incorrect. Summative 
                assessments are usually in form of tests, which can either be practical or theory. </p><br>

              <p>Assessment strategies and tasks “can offer rich teaching and learning opportunities for both teachers and learners” 
                (Spiller, 2012: 3). I believe that if effective assessment strategies are implemented, these can provide guidance and feedback to 
                learners and help them enhance their ability, identify their strengths and weaknesses, and develop confidence in a subject and in 
                their learning process.  Teachers can also obtain valuable feedback for improving their quality of teaching and the relevant learning 
                produced: as observed by Ramsden (2003), assessment is an integral part of teaching and is critical for improving teaching.</p><br>

            <h2>Support for student development</h2>
            <p>In the beginning of the term I always inform my students about consultation times and I have posted a schedule on my door. I use 
              consultation time so that I can provide extra support to groups or individual students. The one on one support is always effective 
              since it addresses the specific needs of the students concerned. My philosophy on assisting students at risk is proactive rather 
              than the usual reactive approach of analyzing student performance after an assessment.  By definition, risk assessment ought to be 
              done before undertaking a task. Therefore, in addition to the official protocol of identifying students at risk , I also use 
              proactive tools such as platform quizizz.com and the discursive forum answergarden.ch. With these two platforms, I’m able to 
              adjust my teaching content and methods before its too late. Quizizz.com gives me quantitative information on students at risk 
              before I engage with them whilst answergarden.ch allows student to express themselves more hence i get qualitative information 
              on what sort of interventions are required.  To assist student at risk, I do one-on-one or group consultations. I also recommend 
              additional material such as videos. I noted that having to wait until the official lists of students at risk will be too late for 
              any meaningful intervention. In this section, however, I will not dwell much on this usual rhetoric, instead I will present evidence 
              and student testimonies based on my belief that that my responsibility as a teacher does not end with the basics as stipulated in the 
              job description. Influenced by this personal philosophy, I present evidence that demonstrate how as a lecturer I go an extra mile by 
              (i) supporting students after graduation (ii) Develop students interested in entrepreneurship (iii) exposing students to industry & 
              community projects. (iv) being a life coach and role mode</p><br>

            <p>I also believe that it is important to develop students holistically for them to make the correct decisions in life. Apart from the 
              academic projects that are given to the students to enrich them in Environmental Health, I find time in class, to speak to students 
              about financial matters and the need to save after they have been employed. During these discussions I get to understand the students 
              better, learning about their backgrounds and the challenges they are faced with in everyday life</p><br>

            <h2>Scholarly activities that influence and enhance teaching and learning</h2>
            <p>The field of Environmental Health has evolved over the years (from producing Environmental Health Officers to Practitioners). 
              Furthermore, transitioning from offering diplomas to Bachelor of Science in Environmental Health.; hence it is imperative to be up 
              to date with not only the current trends in the field but the current trends in teaching the subject. It is thus essential as an 
              academic, to engage in scholarly activities. In this section, I present scholarly activities that have shaped the way I teach and 
              develop learning material.</p><br>

            <p>I took up the exciting challenge by informally sharing my personal experiences and learnt from experiences of my experienced 
              colleagues, teaming up with colleagues in Analytical Chemistry, Maths and Biomedical sciences. This collaboration aimed at sharing 
              teaching experiences and coaching each other in areas that need strengthening.</p><br>

            <p>Furthermore, as a lecturer, I was keen on investigating the factors that affect academic performance of my students. The results 
              revealed that students who are pre-occupied with other activities on campus struggle to make it through first year. The findings from 
              my investigation has informed my approach when talking to students. Now I use a variety of methods to motivate my students. I use examples 
              that help them to see and understand the social issues in their environment. In Environmental Health Promotion I engage them in projects 
              that are based on health education. In the topics that I give them, I target to assist them.</p><br>

            <p>I always participate in monitoring our students during work integrated learning (WIL). During my visits to different stakeholders 
              that take our students, I always interview them in order to improve my teaching practice.</p><br>

            <p>Some of subjects that I have thought needed laboratory experiments, I always had to work them out first and see if they will be 
              workable. It demanded a lot of work in the laboratory for preparations.</p><br>

            <p>Our Institution (MUT) has been known over the years to be producing competent students, the department of Environmental Health has 
              been in the for front in this mission. As a department, we aim to produce competent and confident graduates who are able to compete 
              in the job market. It is therefore, imperative that we evaluate our processes and methods. </p><br>
